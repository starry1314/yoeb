DISCLAIMER
Be aware that using this bot is against the PATH OF EXILE TERMS OF USE agreement and it may lead your account to be banned eventually.
Bans are very rare these days - nevertheless DO NOT USE the bot on your main account if you care about it. Botting on HARDCORE is also not a good use case and requires high survivability.


HOW TO START
We made a detailed video for the initial setup and how to start mapping for the first time.

THINGS TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT
While using a different account to bot - it may be connected to your main-account by ip / mac adress / similar. To avoid being banned on your main at the same time - you will have to use a different pc or a virtual machine + VPN.
As already stated before - bans are almost never happening when you are experienced in botting. Be aware that your beginning might be different.

GENERAL THINGS
- Pause and Unpause the bot by pressing F12 - changes in settings are not reloaded
- STOP and START reloads all settings
- You can reload your ini files during runtime as well by pressing F11
- GUI settings not clear? Hover your mouse over it and you'll get some information
- You can check config.ini, skills.ini and pickit.ini files for more infos, everything is pretty self-explenatory or you can read the comments when it's not
- The only microtransaction tab which works is the currency one - quad tab does work but only for storing items. The mtx map tab does not work!
- Use afinities to store things in specific stash tabs which the bot should not access (for example unique items)
