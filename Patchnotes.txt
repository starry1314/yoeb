Fixed breakable chest detection.
Image detection default values reduced.
Added keys in system.ini file to setup the shade variation of image detection (gem_leveling_shade_variation, npc_sentence_shade_variation, frozen_poe_shade_variation, error_messages_shade_variation). Values can be 0-100. Increasing these values will make the bot more accurate but more likely to miss the image, reducing them will make the bot more likely to find the image and more likely to false positives. Even if some of these keys were already there in previous versions, they weren't used by the bot.

0.68
Added automatic use of augmentation orb with maps (be sure that you enable map upgrading to magic).
Now bot can use any type of flask (To use utility flasks you have to setup in the override when to use [below Life/ES/Mana %]).
Override setting logic changed so it will actually override the Basic setting. For example if you have a life flask set to use below 70% in override then the Basic flask system will not use that life flask at all.
In short any flask you setup in override will be used ONLY (and without any other condition) when the override condition is met. (If you set two life flasks to 70% in override both will be used together).
For more infos about new flask system checker here : https://exiled-bot.net/community/index.php/topic/8331-tabs-explained/
Bot also now will use all required flasks together without delay (before if you had low life and had bleeding it would first use life flask then after a while use the dispel flask, now it will use both at the same time).
